# Deployment with Apollo Universal Starter Kit

## Deploying to Linux Running on Node.js

1. Clone the latest stable branch of Apollo Universal Starter Kit and `cd` into the project folder:

```bash
git clone -b stable https://github.com/sysgears/apollo-universal-starter-kit.git
cd apollo-universal-starter-kit
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

**NOTE**: Apollo Starter Kit uses Yarn's special feature to handle the package architecture &ndash; workspaces. Using
Yarn workspaces allows us to install all the dependencies that are listed in the root `package.json` as well as the
dependencies in `packages/client/package.json`, `packages/server/package.json`, and `packages/mobile/package.json` from
the root project directory.

Managing packages architecture the same way isn't possible with NPM, which is why we're using Yarn. Otherwise, you'll
have to install the dependencies separately from each package &ndash; client, server, and mobile &ndash; to be able to
run the project.

3. Seed the data to the database for production:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production yarn seed
```

4. Set `SERVER_PORT` and `WEBSITE_URL` environment variables to match your production setup or edit
`packages/server/build.config.js`:

```javascript
const config = ...;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  config.__SERVER_PORT__ = 8080; // Change to the production port
  config.__WEBSITE_URL__ = '"https://your-website-name.com"'; // Change to the production domain
}
```

5. If you need to run the mobile app, set `API_URL` and `WEBSITE_URL` environment variables to match your production setup or edit `packages/mobile/build.config.js`:

```javascript
const config = ...;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  // Other settings are omitted for brevity
  // Change the following two lines
  config.__API_URL__ = '"https://your-website-name.com/graphql"';
  config.__WEBSITE_URL__ = '"https://your-website-name.com"';
  // Other settings are omitted for brevity
}
```

6. Compile the project for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

7. Run the project in production mode:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Deploying to Heroku

1. Create an account on [Heroku].

2. Install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI):

    - On Ubuntu, run `sudo snap install heroku --classic`
    - For Windows and MacOS, download the appropriate installer from [Heroku CLI]

3. Log in to the Heroku CLI with your Heroku login and password and follow the suggestions shown by the CLI:

```bash
heroku login
```

4. Create your application on Heroku via the CLI. Use the name of your application instead of `application-name`:

```bash
heroku create application-name
```

The command line will generate two links. The link before the pipe is the URL for your Heroku application, while the
URL after the pipe is yhe Git repository to which you'll push your application:

```bash
https://application-name.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/application-name.git
```
Consult [deploying a Node.js app] for full details about creating your application on Heroku.

5. Set your deployment configuration variables in [Heroku Dashboard].

Click the name of your application in the list and then follow to the `Settings` tab. In Settings, click on the
`Config Variables` link and add the following variable:

| Variable        | Value |
| --------------- | ----- |
| YARN_PRODUCTION | false |

**NOTE**: If you don't need the mobile app when deploying to Heroku, rename `heroku-postbuild` script in `packages/mobile/package.json` to something else, so that Heroku doesn't find and run it:

However, if you want to deploy a mobile app, first create an account on [Expo]. Additionally, you need to set these
three variables in Heroku Dashboard:

| Variable        | Value                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| YARN_PRODUCTION | false                      |
| EXP_USERNAME    | your_expo_account_username |
| EXP_PASSWORD    | your_expo_account_password |

**NOTE**: To register new users, configure your SMTP server. By default, Apollo Universal Starter Kit uses [Ethereal]
for the fake SMTP server, but you shouldn't use Ethereal for production application because the registration emails with
the validation link will be sent to Ethereal, _not_ to the real users.

| Variable       | Value                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| EMAIL_HOST     | mailboxExample.example.com |
| EMAIL_PASSWORD | examplePassword            |
| EMAIL_USER     | example@example.com        |
| EMAIL_SENDER   | example@example.com        |

By default Apollo Universal Starter Kit uses `EMAIL_SENDER` as the `from` e-mail address for all mail sent. It will fall back to `EMAIL_USER` if `EMAIL_SENDER` is not set.

6. Set a proper value for the server website URL in `WEBSITE_URL` environment variable or inside `packages/server/build.config.js` to match your production setup.

* If you're deploying your application on Heroku without a custom domain name, the production URL will look similar to this: `https://application-name.herokuapp.com`

`application-name` is the name of your application you've generated at the step 4 (creation of an app with the Heroku
CLI).

* If you're using a custom domain, the production URL will look like this: `https://domain-example.com`


Remember to add the custom domain in [Heroku Dashboard]. Select your application from the list, and then follow to the
`Settings` tab. Scroll to the button **Add domain** and add your domain.

7. If you're deploying your mobile app to Expo, you need to connect the app to the back-end URL. To do that set `API_URL` and `WEBSITE_URL` environment variable or edit `packages/mobile/build.config.js`:

```javascript
const config = ...;

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  config.__API_URL__ = '"https://application-name.herokuapp.com/graphql"';
  config.__WEBSITE_URL__ = '"https://application-name.herokuapp.com"';
}
```

8. Configure other Apollo Starter Kit modules such as [the Stripe module] if necessary.

9. Commit your changes and run the command below with the name of your application instead of `application-name`:

```bash
git push https://git.heroku.com/application-name.git
```

If you're deploying from another branch (not from master) run:

```bash
git push --force heroku your_branch:master
```

10. Heroku will automatically build your project. The website will be published to Heroku, and the mobile app will be
available on [Expo.io].

## Publishing a Mobile App

1. Run the following command to publish your mobile app:

```bash
yarn expo publish
```

## Building a Standalone Mobile App for Google Play or App Store

1. Run the command below to build a signed `.apk` for Android:

```bash
yarn expo ba
```

You need to run the command below to build a signed `.iap` for iOS:

```bash
yarn expo bi
```

3. Run `yarn expo bs` to get the status and links for signed standalone mobile apps when the build finishes.

For more details refer to Building Standalone Apps in [the Expo documentation].
